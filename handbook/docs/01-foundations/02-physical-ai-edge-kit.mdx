# The Physical AI Edge Kit

After developing and refining your robotic agents in the Digital Twin Workstation, the next crucial step is to deploy them to real-world hardware. This is where the Physical AI Edge Kit comes in. It's a compact, energy-efficient computing platform designed for real-time inference and interaction with the physical world.

The Edge Kit acts as the "body" for your AI agents, allowing them to perceive their environment through sensors and execute actions through actuators, bridging the gap between simulation and reality.

## Hardware Recommendations

The components of the Edge Kit are chosen for their balance of processing power, sensor capabilities, and compatibility with the ROS 2 ecosystem.

| Component         | Recommendation                       | Description                                                   |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brain**         | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) or Orin NX | High-performance, energy-efficient AI computer for edge inference. |
| **Eyes**          | Intel RealSense D435i or D455      | Depth-sensing camera for 3D perception and spatial awareness. |
| **Ear/Voice**     | ReSpeaker USB Mic Array              | Multi-microphone array for capturing and processing audio commands. |
| **Connectivity**  | Wi-Fi (built-in or USB dongle)       | For communication with the workstation and internet access.   |

## Setting Up Your Edge Kit

### 1. Jetson Orin Setup

The Jetson Orin platform runs a specialized version of Ubuntu. You will typically flash the JetPack SDK onto your Jetson device.

**Key Steps**:
*   **Flash JetPack**: Use NVIDIA SDK Manager to flash the latest JetPack version onto your Jetson Orin Nano/NX. This includes Ubuntu, CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT.
*   **Connect Peripherals**: Attach a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for initial setup.
*   **Network Configuration**: Connect your Jetson to the same network as your Digital Twin Workstation for seamless ROS 2 communication.

### 2. Sensor Integration

#### Intel RealSense Camera

The RealSense camera provides critical depth and RGB data for your robot's perception.

```bash
# Install RealSense SDK
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key F6E6EAD1
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://librealsense.intel.com/Debian/apt-repo $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dkms librealsense2-utils librealsense2-dev librealsense2-dbg
```
Verify installation: Connect your RealSense camera and run `realsense-viewer`.

#### ReSpeaker USB Mic Array

The ReSpeaker provides audio input for voice commands and environmental sound processing.

```bash
# Basic ALSA configuration for USB microphone
# Ensure it's detected: `arecord -l`
# Test recording: `arecord -d 5 -f S16_LE -r 16000 test.wav`
```
Further integration with speech-to-text engines like Whisper will be covered in later chapters.

## Initial Validation

Once all components are connected and configured, you should be able to:
*   Power on the Jetson Orin and access the Ubuntu desktop.
*   View live feed from the RealSense camera using `realsense-viewer`.
*   Verify the ReSpeaker microphone is detected and can record audio.

Your Physical AI Edge Kit is now ready to receive its first AI models!
