# The Digital Twin Workstation

Welcome to the first step in your Physical AI journey. Before we can build the mind of a robot, we must first build its world. A Digital Twin Workstation is a high-performance computer that serves as your virtual laboratory. It's where you will simulate, train, and debug your robotic systems in a perfectly safe, controlled, and cost-free environment before deploying them to physical hardware.

This "sim-first" approach is the core philosophy of modern robotics development. It allows for rapid iteration and testing without the risks and expenses associated with physical hardware.

## Hardware Requirements

The performance of your simulation environment is directly tied to the power of your workstation. While it's possible to use cloud solutions (covered later), having a capable local machine is ideal for a smooth, interactive experience.

### Recommended Specifications

The following specifications are crucial for running complex simulations, especially those involving photorealistic rendering and physics calculations in platforms like NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

| Component | Minimum Requirement                               | Ideal Specification                               |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **GPU**       | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM)            | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 / 4090 (24GB VRAM)          |
| **CPU**       | Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 7 (7000 series+) | Intel Core i9 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9 (7000 series+) |
| **RAM**       | 64 GB DDR5                                        | 128 GB DDR5 or more                               |
| **Storage**   | 1TB NVMe SSD                                      | 2TB+ NVMe SSD                                     |
| **OS**        | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS                                  | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (dedicated, not via VM or WSL2)  |

:::tip Why the focus on GPU?
Robotics simulation, especially with tools like Isaac Sim, relies heavily on the GPU for rendering realistic environments and for accelerating the training of AI models. The **VRAM** is particularly critical, as it determines the complexity of the scenes and models you can load. 24GB of VRAM is the gold standard for serious humanoid simulation.

## Software Installation

With your hardware in place, the next step is to install the core software stack.

### 1. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Ensure you have a clean installation of Ubuntu 22.04. While other versions might work, this is the most commonly supported version across the entire robotics toolchain.

### 2. NVIDIA Drivers
Installing the correct NVIDIA drivers is the most critical step.
```bash
# Add the graphics-drivers PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update

# Install the recommended driver (e.g., 535)
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
```
After installation, reboot your system and verify the installation with `nvidia-smi`.

### 3. ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill)
ROS 2 is the nervous system of our robot. We will use the `Humble` distribution, which is the recommended version for Ubuntu 22.04.

Follow the official ROS 2 installation guide: [ROS 2 Humble Installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

### 4. Gazebo Simulator
Gazebo is a powerful physics simulator. It will be installed as part of the ROS 2 "Desktop" installation.

### 5. NVIDIA Isaac Sim
Isaac Sim is a photorealistic, physics-accurate virtual environment for robotics simulation.

1.  **Install Omniverse Launcher**: Download and install the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher from the [NVIDIA Omniverse website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/).
2.  **Install Isaac Sim**: From the Omniverse Launcher, search for "Isaac Sim" in the Exchange tab and install the latest version.

Once all components are installed, you can launch Isaac Sim and run one of the pre-built demo scenes to verify that your Digital Twin Workstation is fully operational. You are now ready to start building robots.
