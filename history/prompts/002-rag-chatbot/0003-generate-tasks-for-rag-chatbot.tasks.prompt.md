## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the RAG Chatbot feature.

- **Tasks File**: `specs/002-rag-chatbot/tasks.md`
- **Total Tasks**: 16
- **MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Content-Aware Q&A)

The tasks are organized by user story and are ready for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new tasks file for the RAG chatbot feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-rag-chatbot/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `Implement the tasks in tasks.md`
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating tasks from the design documents was successful. The key was to break down the user stories into small, actionable tasks.
